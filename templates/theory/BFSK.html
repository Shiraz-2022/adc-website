                    <p>In binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK), symbols 0 and 1 are
                        distinguished from each other by transmitting one of two
                        sinusoidal waves that differ in frequency by a fixed amount.

            <h4>Binary data stream:</h4>
            <p>A binary data stream is a sequence of bits that represent digital information, such as text, images, audio, or video. Each bit is a binary digit that can have one of two possible values: 0 or 1. The bits are transmitted or stored in a sequential order, with each bit representing a unit of information.</p>

            <h4>Carrier wave:</h4>
            <p> A carrier wave is a high-frequency signal that is modulated to carry information in a communication system. The carrier wave does not carry any information by itself but provides a stable platform for the modulation process. The frequency and amplitude of the carrier wave remain constant while the information is superimposed on it. The carrier wave is typically a sine wave, and its frequency determines the bandwidth of the communication channel.</p>

        <span>
            <h4>Amplitude-shift keying (ASK):</h4>
            <p>Amplitude-shift keying is a digital modulation technique that uses the amplitude of a carrier wave to represent the binary data. In ASK, the amplitude of the carrier wave is switched between two different levels to represent 0 and 1 in the binary data stream. For example, if the carrier wave has an amplitude of A and A/2, it can represent 0 and 1, respectively. The receiver detects the amplitude changes in the carrier wave and decodes them back into the original binary data. ASK is a simple and efficient modulation technique but is sensitive to noise and distortion in the communication channel.</p>
